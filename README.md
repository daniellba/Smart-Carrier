# Smart-Carrier
"Smart Carrier" is project that allow the user to take with him his load of any kind as long it fit the carrier demenstions and it's weight limit.
This carrier is unique becuase it connects to the user phone via appliction and follow him where ever he goes! moreover, the carrier can also be sent to a specific location.

The carrier designed to fit most loads, such as - suitcases, shopping bags, coolers and more.
I planed it to be strong and durable, but not too heavy so it won't impact the load weight.

Since there are a few similer products in the market, one of the main goals was to make it cheap as possible, that's why Arduino suits here the best.
For the electronics particals I choose Arduino, GPS Module, Location Module, Geared 12V DC Motor Ã— 2, battery pack x2, Motor driver and Bluetooth Module.
Those electronics work perfectly togher, easy to operate and power efficent.
In order to make the most of the particals I used 3D printer to print custom parts.
